This static library provides the required `__register_mulle_objc_universe`
function for executables, that link against
[MulleObjCStandardFoundation](//github.com/MulleFoundation/MulleObjCStandardFoundation).

> Hardly anyone ever does this though, except MulleObjCStandardFoundation tests.

Projects will usually rather link against the
[Foundation](//github.com/MulleFoundation/Foundation) though, and will use
its startup library.
